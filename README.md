This repository contains the 3d Game Editor I created to help with the development of our Junior Year custom engine game Lux Cymex.
The repository also contains the actual game which is a 3D Light Combination Puzzle Survival Game.

Features of the editor include:
  *Level Loading/Saving
  
  *Game object creation, deletion, and multi selection
  *installing 3D gizmo that allows for object translation, rotation and scaling
  *game object prefabs
  *Undo Redo with history  
  *Debug drawing for Bullet 3D to draw its bounding boxes
  *Most of the Imgui setup and windows
  *Props window (similar to Inspector window in Unity)
  *Console window
  *Entities window for list of objects in world
