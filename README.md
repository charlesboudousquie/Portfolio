This repository contains the 3d Game Editor I created to help with the development of our 
Junior Year custom engine game Lux Cymex.
The repository also contains the actual game which is a 3D Light Combination Puzzle Survival Game.
The game is centered around the player solving puzzles with different light cominations that can affect the
physics and properties of objects.

Features of the editor include:
  
  *Level Loading/Saving  
  *Game object creation, deletion, and multi selection  
  *installing 3D gizmo that allows for object translation, rotation and scaling  
  *game object prefabs  
  *Undo Redo with history  
  *Debug drawing for Bullet 3D to draw its bounding boxes  
  *Most of the Imgui setup and windows  
  *Props window (similar to Inspector window in Unity)  
  *Console window  
  *Entities window for list of objects in world  

When using Editor:
  Press space to switch between Camera mode(moving around in the world) and Imgui mode(interacting with various
  Imgui windows).
